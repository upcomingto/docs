# How to use

Upcoming has three major functions.

* Set up a meeting
* Join a meeting
* Stay in touch with the meeting

## Set up a meeting

To create a meeting, click on the "mark with a + in the balloon" at the top left of the screen. Or, if you're just signed up, you'll see a link that says "New Meeting". Click it. This will open a screen where you can create a new meeting.

This screen allows you to enter a meeting title, date and time, and content. Although it is a part called "URL", if you sign up with Zoom, the option "Zoom" will be displayed. If you select this, the Zoom meeting URL will be created automatically. If you select "Determine later / Specify URL", you can enter the URL of the meeting in the text box on the right, or you can decide the URL later without entering anything. Meeting URLs that can be entered in the text box on the right include Zoom, Google Meet, Whereby, MS Teams, Facebook Rooms.

Click the save button to complete the creation. After that, the meeting you created will be displayed.

## Invite to a meeting

You can find the URL at the top of the meeting screen. This URL will be different for each meeting. Give this URL to the people who will attend the meeting so that they can see the meeting information.

## Join the meeting

If someone tells you the URL for your meeting, you can visit the meeting page and view information by visiting that URL.
However, if you have never signed up (installed) before, you will need to authenticate with Zoom or Facebook. The procedure for authentication is the same as the procedure described in Signup (installation), but after signing up, the meeting page is displayed.

## Stay in touch with the meeting

On the meeting page, you can write a comment from the right column. This allows you to write down any questions you may have about the meeting, or tell them if you are late for your appointment.

## Other

Upcoming has some other features as well.

### Attach files to meetings

You can send the file you have at the place of "Add file +" on the meeting page. If the sent file is an image, a thumbnail will be displayed. For each file, the file name, the date and time it was sent, and who sent it are displayed.

### Check the list of meetings

After signing up, you will be able to see the upcoming meetings on the top page of the site.
